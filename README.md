<h1 align="ceter"> Discord-bot WeebWatcher</h1>

<h3 align="left"> This project was inspired by a desire to learn more JavaScript and in turn learn about Docker, and CI/CD. This bot currently implements custom commands for;<br>
  - playing music<br>
  - creating a queue through Billboard's Top 100<br>
  - player management<br>
  - Database to keep track of in-guild currencies (sqllite3)<br>
  - Some commands to mess with your friends. <br>
  - multiplayer blackjack feature that creates custom html images for every new table update.
  - Still in production for more features.<br>
Learning Outcomes:<br>
  - OOP practice using discord.js (a Node.js module that allows you to interact with the 
    Discord API).<br>
  - How to build and deploy using Docker, which involved creating Dockerfiles, managing Docker 
    containers, and understanding container orchestration.<br>
